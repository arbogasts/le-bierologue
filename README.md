# Le Biérologue

Le Biérologue is a React based project to help you discover beers in all sorts.

## Why this project ?

It is often difficult to find specific information about the beers we drink.
Most of the time when we are looking for a beer we will just find information that we already have on the beer label: its description, its percentage, its type.
The interest of le Biérologue is precisely to go a little further than that, in a few clicks we can quickly find in which glass to drink his beer (very important), the process of making his beer, his beer style...
